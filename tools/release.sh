## Get $title

**[Get $title from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/$snap)**. That's the way to install and play it, and it keeps the game up to date by itself.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/$snap)

This release goes to the **candidate** channel first, and to stable once it has been tried. To play it now:

\`\`\`sh
sudo snap install $snap --candidate     # new to the game
sudo snap refresh $snap --candidate     # already have it
\`\`\`

### Windows and macOS

Download \`$snap-${tag#v}-windows-x86_64.zip\` or \`$snap-${tag#v}-macos.zip\` from the assets below (they're added a few minutes after the release is published), unzip it and run the game. These builds aren't signed by Microsoft or Apple, so the first time:

- **Windows:** if SmartScreen says it protected your PC, choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **macOS:** open the app once, then go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway**.

Windows and macOS builds don't update themselves; come back here for new releases.
